ABOUT NVIDIA AI model (MolMIM):

MolMIM generates a random sample of new molecules in SMILES format by sampling from the latent space around the point corresponding to the given seed molecule. MolMIM performs optimization with the CMA-ES algorithmin the model’s latent space and sample molecules with improved values of the desired scoring function.

MolMIM is a latent variable model developed by NVIDIA that is trained in an unsupervised manner over a large-scale dataset of molecules in the form of SMILES strings. MolMIM utilizes transformer architecture to learn an informative fixed-size latent space using Mutual Information Machine (MIM) learning. MIM is a learning framework for a latent variable model which promotes informative and clustered latent codes. MolMIM can be used for sampling novel molecules from the model’s latent space.
